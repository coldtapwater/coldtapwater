# frgmt_ AI: Where AI Gets Its Groove Back

Welcome to **frgmt_** AKA **SoFragment**, the home of lightweight, modular AI systems built for people who donâ€™t have time for bloated, resource-hogging nonsense. Weâ€™re not here to reinvent the wheelâ€”weâ€™re here to slap some turbojets on it and see how far we can send it flying.

## **Our Mission?**
To make AI your new sidekickâ€”the Robin to your Batman, the Luigi to your Mario (or the Wario, depending on your vibe). With tools that are practical, punchy, and just a little unhinged, weâ€™re here to show you what AI can *really* do.

## Whatâ€™s Brewing in the frgmt_ Lab?

### SRN: Your Computerâ€™s New Overlord (jk... kinda)
Meet **SRN**, our foundational **Small Action Model (SAM)** that doesnâ€™t just sit around chattingâ€”it *gets stuff done*. Itâ€™s like having a super-efficient intern who doesnâ€™t take coffee breaks or accidentally reply-all.  

**What SRN Brings to the Table:**
- **Doer of Things**: Automates tasks, manages files, and handles all the boring stuff you donâ€™t want to do.  
- **Lightweight AF**: Wonâ€™t slow your system down, unlike *some* AI models we wonâ€™t name (ðŸ‘€).  
- **Smarter Than It Looks**: Adapts to your workflow like it was born to be there.

### SLT-: Build Agents. Unleash... Something?
Coming soon, **SLT-** is the Swiss Army knife of AI frameworks. Want to build agents for your app or personal AI assistant? With **SLT-**, itâ€™s as easy as pieâ€”assuming youâ€™ve ever made pie (which, letâ€™s be real, can be kind of tricky). But **SLT-**? SLT-â€™s easy.  

**Why SLT- is a Game-Changer:**
- **Agents Galore**: Create specialized agents that actually *know what theyâ€™re doing*.  
- **Ridiculously Modular**: Fits into any project like it was meant to be there.  
- **Developer-Friendly**: Because struggling with tools is so last decade.

### fRM: Rust-Powered ORM for the Brave.
**fRM** is an **ORM for Rust**â€”but forget the heavy, over-engineered nonsense. fRM is fast, lean, and as sleek as its name suggests. Built *in Rust, for Rust*, itâ€™s a developerâ€™s dream if youâ€™re tired of working with bulky, cumbersome systems.  

**Why fRM is a Power Move:**
- **Blazing Fast**: Rust isnâ€™t slow, and neither is fRM.  
- **Sleek Design**: Minimal fluff, maximum performance.  
- **Rust to the Core**: No borrowed ideas hereâ€”just borrowed references.  

If youâ€™ve been searching for a lightweight ORM that stays out of your way but gives you all the power, **fRM** is calling your name.

## Why frgmt_? Because Why Not?
Hereâ€™s the thing: most AI out there is either bloated, overly complicated, or just... meh. Weâ€™re here to fix that by building tools that:  
- Fit into your workflow like a glove. A really smart glove.  
- Actually help, instead of making you question your life choices.  
- Are more compact than your average IKEA manual but infinitely more useful.  

Weâ€™re all about minimal fluff, maximum punch. No jargon-y nonsense, just clever tools with a mischievous streak. If that sounds like your vibe, youâ€™re in the right place.

## Join the Madness
Weâ€™re just getting started, which means nowâ€™s the perfect time to jump on the bandwagon. Whether youâ€™re a developer, creator, or just someone who likes to see what AI can do, weâ€™d love for you to join us.  

Thanks for stopping by **frgmt_**, where the AI is sharp, the sarcasm is sharper, and the possibilities are endless. Letâ€™s make something epic togetherâ€¦ or weirdâ€¦ weâ€™re good with weird. :>
