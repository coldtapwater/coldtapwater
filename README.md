This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my work, skills, and journey as a developer and digital creator. The site is a mix of professionalism and creativity, featuring:

- **Projects**: A collection of the things I've built, with details on each project.

- **About Me**: An overview of my background, skills, and the fun things that make me who I am.

- **Art & Photography**: A gallery of my digital art and photography, presented in a visually engaging layout.

- **Blog**: A space where I share updates on what I’m working on and what I’m learning.

The website uses clean, modern design principles and includes interactive animations and responsive layouts for a great user experience. It reflects who I am as both a developer and a creative thinker.
